The project is to find the maximum estimated amount of time for the student takes to graduate in CSUF. This project we designed and implemented algorithm related to directed acyclic graphs (DAG).There are three inputs provided in the form of text files denoting the courses and their mapping. Our goal is to read the text file that has given and create the node and make mapping as a directed acyclic graph. This graph passed as inputs to the sort as topologically sort, then finding the length of the longest path of the semester and the longest path that the student takes to graduate.

Feed the input files as .txt format in the code that parses the data to get the desired output.

We have used Java as a programming language to code.
